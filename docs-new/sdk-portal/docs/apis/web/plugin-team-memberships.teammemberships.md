## TeamMemberships variable

Team Memberships represent a person's relationship to a team. Use this API to list members of any team that you're in or create memberships to invite someone to a team. Team memberships can also be updated to make someone a moderator or deleted to remove them from the team.

Just like in the Webex app, you must be a member of the team in order to list its memberships or invite people.
